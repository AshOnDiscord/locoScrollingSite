# locoScrollingSite
This is a personal Site with massive inspiration from <a href="https://iuri.is/">Iuri.is</a>.  
It uses Locomotive Scroll(for scrolling effect), some vanilla JS as well as vanilla CSS along with TailwindCSS and of course HTML.  
If you want you can give suggestions you can make an issue with the enhancement tag or put "(suggestion)" in the title of the issue.
